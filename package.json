  "description": "Simple-Jade-Parser is a convenience library that makes working with Jade even easier. It serves as the sole reference point for rendering Jade files with a simple API that uses promises, has great error handling, and helps with \"fractal design\" in frameworks like Express as opposed to having a single `views/` directory.",
